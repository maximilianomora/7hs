Things to do to TortoiseCVS web site
------------------------------------

Development page:
	Describe CVS->Checkout TortoiseCVS/wxWidgets features
	Describe CVS->Make Patch feature in TortoiseCVS
	Compiling with latest Win32 headers for shell column stuff
	Split programmer stuff into separate page, and talk about
		translation, testing, other ways to help as well?

Make tables always the same width (fixed width on left bar)

All the *.html files are the helped shipped with app, *.shtml
	are just for the web site.  This feels a bit disordered, but
	actually works quite well.  Think of a better way that 
	makes the look and feel of the web site more consistent?
	Credits and contributors are very similar pages, faq.html could
	be more prominant on the website support section, as could
	the guide.html and legal.html pages.
